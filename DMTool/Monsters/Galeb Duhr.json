If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed or frightened, and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell)."}],"hit_dice":"9d8 + 45","level":"6","name":"Galeb Duhr","class":null,"strength":20,"dexterity":14,"constitution":20,"intelligence":12,"wisdom":11,"charisma":11,"armor_class":16,"speed":" 15 ft.
