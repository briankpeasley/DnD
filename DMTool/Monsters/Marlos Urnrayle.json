He can move through solid earth and rock as if it were difficult terrain.

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see Marlos until the start of its next turn, when it can decide to avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Marlos in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Marlos sees himself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of him and in an area of bright light, Marlos is, due to his curse, affected by his own gaze."}],"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"Marlos makes three melee attacks, one with his snake hair and two with Ironfang."},{"name":"Snake Hair","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
