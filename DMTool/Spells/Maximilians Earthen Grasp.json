A medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one create you can see within 5 feet of it.  The target must make a Strenght save throw.  On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.  As an action you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strenght saving throw.  It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength heck against your spell save DC.  On a success, the aget escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.  As an action you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range.  The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>","higher_level":null,"range":"30 feet","components":"V, S, M (a miniature handl sculpted from clay)","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":"2nd-level","Cooldown":false}
