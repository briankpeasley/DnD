{"name": "Light ", "level": "1", "areaOfEffect": "2\" radius globe\n", "casting_time": "4 segments", "range": "12\"", "components": "V, S", "duration": "6 turns + 1 turn/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> This spell causes excitation of molecules so as to make them brightly luminous. The light thus caused is equal to torch light in brightness, but its sphere is limited to 4\" in diameter. It lasts for the duration indicated (7 turns at 1st experience level, 8 at 2nd, 9 at 3rd, etc.) or until the caster utters a word to extinguish the light. The Light spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions, except the blackness persists for only one half the duration that light would last. If this spell is cast upon a creature, the applicable magic resistance and saving throw dice rolls must be made. Success indicates that the spell affects the area immediately behind the creature, rather than the creature itself. In all other cases, the spell takes effect where the caster directs as long as he or she has a line of sight or unobstructed path for the spell; fight can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance.\n</p>"}
