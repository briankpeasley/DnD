{"name": "Remove Curse ", "level": "3", "areaOfEffect": "Special\n", "casting_time": "6 segments", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S", "duration": "Permanent", "savingThrow": "Special", "desc": "<p> Upon casting this spell, the cleric is usually able to remove a curse - whether it be on an object, a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the Remove Curse spell will not affect a cursed shield, weapon or suit of armour, for example, although the spell will typically enable the person afflicted with any such cursed item to be rid of it. The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the Bestow Curse lasts for 1 turn for every level of experience of the cleric using the spell. It will lower one ability of the victim to 3 (your DM will determine which by random selection) 50% of the time; reduce the victim's \"to hit\" and saving throw probabilities by -4 25% of the time; or make the victim 50% likely per turn to drop whatever he, she, or it is holding (or simply do nothing in the case of creatures not using tools) 25% of the time. It is possible for a cleric to devise his or her own curse, and it should be similar in power to those shown. Consult your referee. The target of a Bestow Curse spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; and if it is successful, the effect is negated.\n</p>"}
