{"name": "Sticks To Snakes ", "level": "4", "areaOfEffect": "1 cubic\"\n", "casting_time": "7 segments", "range": "3\"", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "2 rounds/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> By means of this spell the cleric is able to change 1 stick to a snake for each level of experience he or she has attained, i.e. a 9th level cleric can change 9 sticks into 9 snakes. These snakes will attack as commanded by the cleric. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Note that magical items such as staves and spears which are enchanted are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect will be changed. The probability of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per level of experience of the spell caster, so that there is a 55% probability of any given snake created by the spell being poisonous when sticks are turned to snakes by an 11th level cleric, 60% at 12th level, etc. The effect lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the spell caster. The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales. The reverse changes snakes to sticks for the duration appropriate, or it negates the Sticks To Snakes spell according to the level of the cleric countering the spell, i.e. a 10th level cleric casting the reverse spell can turn only 10 snakes back to sticks.\n</p>"}
