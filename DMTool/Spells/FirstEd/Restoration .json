{"name": "Restoration ", "level": "7", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "3 rounds", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S", "duration": "Permanent", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient creature is raised upwards by one. This subsumes previous life energy level drain of the creature by some force or monster. Thus, if a 10th level character had been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, the Restoration spell would bring the character up to exactly the number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to 10th level once again. and restoring additional hit dice (or hit points) and level functions accordingly. Restoration is only effective if the spell is cast within 1 day/level of experience of the cleric casting it of the recipient's loss of life energy. The reverse, Energy Drain, draws away a life energy level (cf. such \"undead\" as spectre, wight, vampire). The Energy Drain requires the victim to be touched. A Restoration spell will restore the intelligence of a creature affected by a Feeblemind spell (q.v.).\n</p>"}
