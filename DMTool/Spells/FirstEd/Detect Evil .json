{"name": "Detect Evil ", "level": "1", "areaOfEffect": "1\" path\n", "casting_time": "1 round", "range": "12\"", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "1 turn + \u00bd turn/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> This is a spell which discovers emanations of evil, or of good in the case of the reverse spell, from any creature or object. For example, evil alignment or an evilly cursed object will radiate evil, but a hidden trop or an unintelligent viper will not. The duration of a Detect Evil (or Detect Good) spell is 1 turn + \u00bd turn (5 rounds, or 5 minutes) per level of the cleric. Thus a cleric of 1st level of experience can cast a spell with a 1\u00bd turn duration, at 2nd level a 2 turn duration, 2\u00bd at 3rd, etc. The spell has a path of detection 1\" wide in the direction in which the cleric is facing. It requires the use of the cleric's holy (or unholy) symbol as its material component, with the cleric holding it before him or her.\n</p>"}
