{"name": "Heal ", "level": "6", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "1 round", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S", "duration": "Permanent", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> The very potent Heal spell enables the cleric to wipe away disease and injury in the creature who receives the benefits of the spell. It will completely cure any and all diseases and/or blindness of the recipient and heal all hit points of damage suffered due to wounds or injury, save 1 to 4 (d4). It dispels a Feeblemind spell. Naturally, the effects can be negated by later wounds, injuries, and diseases. The reverse, Harm, infects the victim with a disease and causes loss of all hit points, as damage, save 1 to 4 (d4), if a successful touch is inflicted. For creatures not affected by the Heal (or Harm) spell, see Cure Light Wounds.\n</p>"}
