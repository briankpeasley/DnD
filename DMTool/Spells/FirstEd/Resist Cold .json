{"name": "Resist Cold ", "level": "1", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "1 round", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "1 turn/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When this spell is placed on a creature by a cleric, the creature's body is inured to cold. The recipient can stand zero degrees Fahrenheit without discomfort, even totally nude. Greater cold, such as that produced by a sword of cold, ice storm, cold wand, or white dragon's breath, must be saved against. All saving throws against cold are made with a bonus of +3, and damage sustained is one-half (if the saving throw is not made) or one-quarter (if the saving throw is made) of damage normal from that attack form. The resistance lasts for 1 turn per level of experience of the caster. A pinch of sulphur is necessary to complete this spell.\n</p>"}
