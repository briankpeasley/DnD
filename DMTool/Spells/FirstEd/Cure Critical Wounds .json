The cleric lays his or her hand upon a creature and heals from 6 to 27 (3d8+3) hit points of damage from wounds or other damage. The spell does not affect creatures excluded in the Cure Light Wounds spell explanation. Its reverse, Cause Critical Wounds, operates in the same fashion as other Cause Wounds spells, requiring a successful touch to inflict the 6-27 hit points of damage. Caused wounds heal as do wounds of other sorts.\n</p>"}
