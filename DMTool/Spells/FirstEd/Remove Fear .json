{"name": "Remove Fear ", "level": "1", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "4 segments", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S", "duration": "Special", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> By touch, the cleric instils courage in the spell recipient, raising the creature's saving throw against magical fear attacks by +4 on dice rolls for 1 turn. If the recipient has already been affected by fear, and failed the appropriate saving throw, the touch allows another saving throw to be made, with a bonus of +1 on the dice for every level of experience of the caster, i.e. a 2nd level cleric gives a +2 bonus, a 3rd level +3, etc. A \"to hit\" dice roll must be made to touch an unwilling recipient. The reverse of the spell, Cause Fear, causes the victim to flee in panic at maximum movement speed away from the caster for 1 round per level of the cleric causing such fear. Of course, Cause Fear can be countered by Remove Fear and vice versa.\n</p>"}
