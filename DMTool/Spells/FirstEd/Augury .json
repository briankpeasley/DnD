{"name": "Augury ", "level": "2", "casting_time": "2 rounds", "range": "0", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "Special", "savingThrow": "None\n", "desc": "<p> The cleric casting an Augury spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate future (within 3 turns) will be for the benefit of, or harmful to, the party. The base chance for correctly divining the augury is 70%, plus 1% far each level of the cleric casting the spell, i.e. 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc, Your referee will determine any adjustments due far the particular conditions of each augury. For example, assume that a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal which closes a portal. Augury is used to find if weal or woe will be the ultimate result to the party. The material component for Augury is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens, or the wet leaves of on infusion which remain in the container after the infused brew is consumed. If the last method is used, a crushed pearl of at least 100 g.p. value must be added to the concoction before it is consumed.\n</p>"}
