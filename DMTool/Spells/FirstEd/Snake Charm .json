{"name": "Snake Charm ", "level": "2", "areaOfEffect": "Special\n", "casting_time": "5 segments", "range": "3\"", "components": "V, S", "duration": "Special", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern is set up which causes one or more snakes to cease all activity except a semi-erect postured swaying movement. If the snakes are charmed while in a torpor, the duration of the spell is 3 to 6 turns (d4 + 2); if the snakes are not torpid, but are not aroused and angry, the charm lasts 1 to 3 turns; if the snakes are angry and/or attacking, the snake charm spell will last from 5 to 8 melee rounds (d4+4). The cleric casting the spell can charm snakes whose hit points are less than or equal to those of the cleric. On the average, a 1st level cleric could charm snakes with a total of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd level cleric 9 hit points, a 3rd level 13 or 14 hit points, etc. The hit points can represent a single snake or several of the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot exceed those of the cleric casting the spell.\n</p>"}
