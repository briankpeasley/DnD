If the saving throw is not made, the creature will attack another and totally ignore the cleric protected by the spell. If the saving throw is made, the cleric is subject to normal attack process including dicing for weapons to hit, saving throws, damage. Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks (Fireball, Ice Storm, etc.). During the period of protection afforded by this spell, the cleric cannot take offensive action, but he or she may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way which does not violate the prohibition against offensive action, This allows the cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a light in the area (not upon on opponent!), and so on, The components of the spell include the cleric's holy/unholy symbol and a small silver mirror.\n</p>"}
