{"name": "Protection From Evil ", "level": "1", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "4 segments", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "5 rounds/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When this spell is cast, it acts as if it were a magical armour upon the recipient. The protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or conjured nature such as aerial servants, demons, devils, djinn, efreet, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, night hags, quasits, salamanders, water weirds, wind walkers, and xorn. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected creature. Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by evil creatures incur a penalty of -2 from dice rolls \"to hit\" the protected creature, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected creature's dice. This spell can be reversed to become Protection From Good, although it still keeps out enchanted evil creatures as well. To complete this spell, the cleric must truce a 3' diameter circle upon the floor (or ground) with holy water for Protection From Evil, with blood for Protection From Good - or in the air using burning incense or smouldering dung with respect to evil/good.\n</p>"}
