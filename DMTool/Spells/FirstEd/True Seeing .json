{"name": "True Seeing ", "level": "5", "areaOfEffect": "12\" sight range\n", "casting_time": "8 segments", "range": "Touch", "components": "V,S,M", "duration": "1 round/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When the cleric employs this spell, all things within the area of the True Seeing effect appear as they actually are. Secret doors become plain. The exact location of displaced things is obvious. Invisible things and those which are astral or ethereal become quite visible. Illusions and apparitions are seen through. Polymorphed, changed, or magicked things are apparent. Even the aura projected by creatures becomes visible, so that the cleric is able to know whether they are good or evil or between. The spell requires an ointment for the eyes. The ointment is made from very rare mushroom powder, saffron, and fat. The reverse of the spell, False Seeing, causes the person to see things as they are not, rich being poor, rough smooth, beautiful ugly. The ointment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil, poppy dust, and pink orchid essence. For both spells, the ointment must be aged for 1-6 months.\n</p>"}
