All sound is stopped, so all conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast and no noise whatsoever issues forth, The spell can be cast into the air or upon an object. The spell of Silence lasts for 2 rounds for each level of experience of the cleric, i.e. 2 rounds at 1st level, 4 at 2nd, 6 at 3rd, 8 at 4th and so forth. The spell can be cast upon a creature, and the effect will then radiate from the creature and move as it moves. If the creature is unwilling, it saves against the spell, and if the saving throw is made, the spell effect locates about one foot behind the target creature.\n</p>"}
