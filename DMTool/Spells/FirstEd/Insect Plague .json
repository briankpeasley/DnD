{"name": "Insect Plague ", "level": "5", "areaOfEffect": "36\" diameter, 6\" high cloud\n", "casting_time": "1 turn", "range": "36\"", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "1 turn/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When this spell is cast by the cleric, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects swarm in a thick cloud. These insects obscure vision, limiting it to 3\". Creatures within the insect plague sustain 1 hit point of damage for each melee round they remain in it due to the bites and stings of the insects, regardless of armour class. The referee will cause all creatures with fewer than five hit dice to check morale. Creatures with two or fewer hit dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a straight line in a random direction until they are not less than 24\" distant from the cloud of insects. Creatures with fewer than five hit dice which fail their morale check will behave likewise. Heavy smoke will drive off insects within its bounds. Fire will also drive insects away; a Wall of Fire in a ring shape will keep the Insect Plague outside its confines, but a Fireball will simply clear insects from its blast area for 1 turn. Lightning and cold/ice act likewise. The plague lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric casting the spell, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area which centres around a summoning point determined by the spell caster, which point can be up to 36\" distant from the cleric. The Insect Plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by casting a Dispel Magic upon the summoning point. A cube of force (a special magic item) would keep insects away from a character seeking the centre of the swarm, but invisibility would afford no protection. The material components of this spell area few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat.\n</p>"}
