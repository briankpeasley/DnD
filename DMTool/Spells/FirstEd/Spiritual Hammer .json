{"name": "Spiritual Hammer ", "level": "2", "areaOfEffect": "One opponent\n", "casting_time": "5 segments", "range": "3\"", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "1 round/level", "savingThrow": "Special", "desc": "<p> By calling upon his or her deity, the cleric casting a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force which is shaped vaguely like a hammer. This area of force is hammer-sized, and as long as the cleric who invoked it concentrates upon the hammer, it will strike at any opponent within its range as desired by the cleric. The force area strikes as a magical weapon equal to one plus per 3 levels of experience of the spell caster for purposes of being able to strike creatures, although it has no magical plusses whatsoever \"to hit\", and the damage it causes when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, i.e. 1-6 versus opponents of man-sire or smaller, 1-4 upon larger opponents. Furthermore, the hammer strikes at exactly the same level as the cleric controlling it, just as if the cleric was personally wielding the weapon. As soon as the cleric ceases concentration, the Spiritual Hammer is dispelled. Note</p>"}
