{"name": "Quest ", "level": "5", "areaOfEffect": "One creature\n", "casting_time": "8 segments", "range": "6\"", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "Until fulfilled", "savingThrow": "Neg.", "desc": "<p> The Quest is a spell by means of which the cleric requires the affected creature to perform a service and return to the cleric with proof that the deed was accomplished. The Quest can, for example, require the location and return of some important or valuable object, the rescue of a notable person, the release of some creature, the capture of a stronghold, the slaying of a person, the delivery of some item, and so forth. If the Quest is not properly followed due to disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving throw dice for each day of such action, and this penalty will not be removed until the Quest is properly discharged or the cleric cancels it. (There are certain circumstances which will temporarily suspend a Quest, and other which will discharge or cancel it; your Dungeon Master will give you appropriate information as the need to know arises.) The material component of this spell is the cleric's religious symbol.\n</p>"}
