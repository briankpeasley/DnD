{"name": "Speak With The Dead ", "level": "3", "areaOfEffect": "One creature\n", "casting_time": "1 turn", "range": "1", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "Special", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> Upon casting a Speak With The Dead spell, the cleric is able to ask several questions of a dead creature in a set period of time and receive answers according to the knowledge of that creature. Of course, the cleric must be able to converse in the language which the dead creature once used. The length of time the creature has been dead is a factor, since only higher level clerics can converse with the long-dead. Likewise, the number of questions which can be answered and the length of time in which the questions can be asked are dependent upon the level of experience of the cleric. The cleric needs a holy symbol and burning incense in order to cast this spell upon the body, remains, or portion thereof.  See PHB for duration.\n</p>"}
