{"name": "Regenerate ", "level": "7", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "5 rounds", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "Permanent", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> When a Regenerate spell is cast, body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even the heads of multi-headed creatures), bones, or organs will grow back. The process of regeneration requires but 1 round if the member(s) severed is (are) present and touching the creature, 2-8 turns otherwise. The reverse, Wither, causes the member or organ touched to shrivel and cease functioning in 1 round, dropping off into dust in 2-8 turns. As is usual, creatures must be touched in order to have harmful effect occur. The material components of this spell are a prayer device and holy/unholy water.\n</p>"}
