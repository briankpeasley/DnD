{"name": "Continual Light ", "level": "3", "areaOfEffect": "6\" radius globe\n", "casting_time": "6 segments", "range": "12\"", "components": "V, S", "duration": "Permanent", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> This spell is similar to a Light spell, except that it lasts until negated (by a Continual Darkness or Dispel Magic spell) and its brightness is very great, being nearly as illuminating as full daylight. It can be cast into air, onto an object, or at a creature, In the third case, the Continual Light affects the space about one foot behind the creature if the latter makes its saving throw. Note that this spell will blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the visual organs, for example. Its reverse causes complete absence of light.\n</p>"}
