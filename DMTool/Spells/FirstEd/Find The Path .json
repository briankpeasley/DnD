{"name": "Find The Path ", "level": "6", "areaOfEffect": "Creature touched\n", "casting_time": "3 rounds", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "1 turn/level", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> By use of this spell, the cleric is enabled to find the shortest, most direct route that he or she is seeking, be it the way to or from or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors or underground, a trap or even a maze spell. The spell will enable the cleric to select the correct direction which will eventually lead him or her to egress, the exact path to follow (or actions to take), and this knowledge will persist as long as the spell lasts, i.e. 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric casting find the path. The spell frees the cleric, and those with him or her from a Maze spell in a single melee round and will continue to do so as long as the spell lasts. The material component of this spell is a set of divination counters of the sort favoured by the cleric - bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, or whatever. The reverse, Lose The Path, makes the creature touched totally lost and unable to find its way for the duration of the spell, although it can be led, of course.\n</p>"}
