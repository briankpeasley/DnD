The cleric is able to ask questions, receive answers, and generally be on amicable terms with the animal. This ability lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the cleric employing the spell. Even if the bent of the animal is opposite to that of the cleric (evil/good, good/evil), it and any others of the same kind with it will not attack while the spell lasts. If the animal is neutral or of the some general bent as the cleric (evil/evil, good/good), there is a possibility that the animal, and its like associates, will do some favour or service for the cleric. This possibility will be determined by the referee by consulting a special reaction chart, using the charisma of the cleric and his actions as the major determinants. Note that this spell differs from speak with monsters (q.v.), for it allows conversation only with basically normal, non-fantastic creatures such as apes, bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on.\n</p>"}
