{"name": "Commune ", "level": "5", "areaOfEffect": "Special\n", "casting_time": "1 turn", "range": "0", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "Special", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> By use of a Commune spell the cleric is able to contact his or her divinity - or agents thereof - and request information in the form of questions which can be answered by a simple \"yes\" or \"no\". The cleric is allowed one such question for every level of experience he or she has attained. The answers given will be correct. It is probable that the referee will limit the use of Commune spells to one per adventure, one per week, or even one per month, for the \"gods\" dislike frequent interruptions. The material components necessary to a Commune spell are the cleric's religious symbol, holy/unholy water, and incense.\n</p>"}
