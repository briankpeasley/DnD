Furthermore, it raises their \"to hit\" dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, will affect only those not already engaged in melee combat. This spell can be reversed by the cleric to a curse upon enemies which lowers morale and \"to hit\" by -1. The caster determines at what range (up to 6\") he or she will cast the spell, and it then affects all creatures in on area 5\" square centred on the point the spell was cast upon. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture components, the Bless requires holy water, while the Curse requires the sprinkling of specially polluted water.\n</p>"}
