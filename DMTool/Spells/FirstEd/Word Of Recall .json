The sanctuary must be specifically designated in advance by the cleric. It must be a well known place, but it can be any distance from the cleric, above or below ground. Transportation by the Word Of Recall spell is infallibly safe. The cleric is able to transport, in addition to himself or herself, 250 gold pieces weight cumulative per level of experience. Thus, a 15th level cleric could transport his or her person and 3,750 (375 pounds) gold pieces weight in addition; this extra matter can be equipment, treasure, or living material such as another person.\n</p>"}
