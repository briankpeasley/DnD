{"name": "Exorcise ", "level": "4", "areaOfEffect": "One creature or object\n", "casting_time": "1-100+ turns", "range": "1", "components": "V, S, M", "duration": "Permanent", "savingThrow": "None", "desc": "<p> The spell of Exorcism will negate possession of a creature or an object by any outside or supernatural force. This includes control of a creature by some force in an object, possession by Magic Jar (q.v.) spell, demonic possession, curse and even charm, for the Exorcise spell is similar to a Dispel Magic spell. Furthermore, it will affect a magical item if such is the object of the exorcism. Thus a soul object of any sort which comes under successful Exorcism will make the life force of the creature concerned wholly inhabit its nearest material body, wholly and completely. (Cf. ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL, Demon.) The Exorcise spell, once begun. cannot be interrupted, or else it is spoiled and useless. The base chance for success is a random 1% to 100%. Each turn of Exorcism the dice are rolled, and if the base chance number, or less, is rolled, the spell is successful. Base chance of success is modified by -1% for each level of difference between the cleric's level of experience and the level of the possessor or possessing magic, where the smaller number is the cleric's level. In the obverse, a +1% cumulative is added. The referee can determine base chance according to the existing circumstances if he or she so desires. Material components for this spell are the holy object of the cleric and holy water (or unholy, in the case of evil clerics, with respect to object and water). A religious artifact or relic can increase the chance of success by from 1% to 50%, according to the power of the artifact or relic.\n</p>"}
