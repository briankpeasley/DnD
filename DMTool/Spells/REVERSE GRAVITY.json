{"name":"Reverse Gravity","desc":"<p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that arenâ€™t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.</p><p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p><p>At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>","higher_level":null,"range":"100 feet","components":"V, S, M","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":"7th-level","Cooldown":false}
