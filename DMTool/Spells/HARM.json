{"name":"Harm","desc":"<p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.</p>","higher_level":null,"range":"60 feet","components":"V, S","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":"6th-level","Cooldown":false}
