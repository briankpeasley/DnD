The DM chooses from the following possible omens:</p><p>- Weal, for good results</p><p>- Woe, for bad results</p><p>- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results</p><p>- Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad</p><p>The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p><p>If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>","higher_level":null,"range":"Self","components":"V, S, M","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level":"2nd-level","Cooldown":false}
