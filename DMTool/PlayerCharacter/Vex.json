The parachute requires at least a 10-foot cube of unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesnâ€™t open fast enough to slow a fall of less than 60 feet. If it has sufficient time and space to deploy properly, the parachute allows its wearer to land without taking falling damage. Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack.","Weight":"","Count":"","Value":""},{"Name":"Scroll of Summon Monster 1","Description":"","Weight":"","Count":"","Value":""}],"Counters":[],"description":null,"ImageLocation":null,"XP":3700.0,"Coin":{"Copper":85,"Silver":28,"Gold":486,"Electrum":0,"Platinum":0,"Total":489.65},"level":"4","name":"Vex","class":"Rogue","strength":12,"dexterity":20,"constitution":14,"intelligence":14,"wisdom":12,"charisma":13,"armor_class":15,"speed":"35","hitPoints":35,"temp_hit_points":0,"damage_log":[],"RemainingHitDice":4,"riders":[],"Cantrips":[],"Level1":[],"Level2":[],"Level3":[],"Level4":[],"Level5":[],"Level6":[],"Level7":[],"Level8":[],"Level9":[],"damage_resistances":null,"damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":null,"Languages":null}
